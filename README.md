## Development Philosophy

Cardinal apps embrace a few simple concepts.

- **To be as platformless as possible**
  - Web technology is platformless, flexible, accessible, and without a corporation gatekeeping an app store. Cardinal apps embrace the web stack, and by designing for the web first, more code covers more platforms.
  - Native apps can be used to wrap and progressively enhance the web apps, to provide them with system functionality and features like file system access, multiprocessing, better databases, and more.
- **Freedom from advertising**
  - All apps are free of tracking, marketing, and ads. No "Updgrade Now" buttons. No paywalled features. No phoning home. No crypto mining. No bundled analytics software. No email address or account required.

## Early Access Considerations

Cardinal apps are early access software, and as such, are subject to breaking changes.
