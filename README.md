# Cardinal-Feedback

### One place for issues/bugs/problems, for all Cardinal apps.

If you run into a bug or problem of any kind with **any** Cardinal app, this is the right place to let the Cardinal developer know. Please create a new [ssue](https://github.com/somebeaver/Cardinal-Feedback/issues/new) describing the problem if an issue for it doesn't already exist.

For general suggestions/feedback, [Reddit](https://old.reddit.com/r/cardinalapps) is a good place for discussion. You may also submit your feedback here on GitHub in the form of an Issue with the `enhancement` tag.
